Step 1:
Download the server.py file and client.py file

Step 2:
The person who wants to host the chat should run the server.py file using the command "python server.py"

Step 3:
After the server is activated the client can join by using the command "python client.py"

Step 4:
Enter your respective names and enjoy chatting. Press EXIT to end the chat and close the connection.

Conditions:
1. This 2-way chat is turn based. The person has to wait for the other person to send his/her message before he/she can send another message. By default the server starts the chat.

2. After a connection is closed, wait for 2 minutes before restarting the server. HACK: To nullify this waiting period, open both server.py and client.py files and change the port number(server.py: line 7 , client.py: line 7) from 12345 to any other number greater than 10000. Make sure that the ports of both files are same.

UPDATE: Waiting Period issue solved. No need to change the port anymore. Enjoy =)

ENJOY :)
